# HTML
D01 contains some work from a 7-day boot camp I attended during the summer of 2018 where I have been exposed to HTML, JQuery, Shell, CSS, Javascript, and the concepts of how to build a website from scratch. 
I have also been exposed to 3D design and printing, along with the concepts of AWS and artificial intelligence.
